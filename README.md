## Blackjack-Project

Project Name: BlackJack

Team Name: Gold Team

Team Members: Kyle Gonzales, Kevin Tripi, Cameron O'Connor

Description: We will be making a game to represent BlackJack. Max card number is 21, and anything over 21 will bust.

User Manual & Implementation: Download the .java file, and run the application. Once the application is opened, click Play. All content is included once downloaded. This is a simple 52 card deck blackjack game against the dealer. Two cards are dealt out to both the player and dealer. The player will decide whether to stay or hit based on his or her hand and the dealers hand. The goal is to get closest to 21 without going over. If the player goes over the dealer wins. If the dealer goes over 21 the player wins. Face cards are worth 10, and Aces are either worth 1/11. The dealer has to hit when his card count is 16 and below and stands on soft 17.
